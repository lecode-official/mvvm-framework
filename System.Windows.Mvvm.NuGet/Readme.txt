MVVM Framework
==============

This MVVM Framework was build on top of ReactiveUI. It enhances
ReactiveUI with a lot of utility functions such as windowing and
navigation services. This project aims at building on those
features that ReactiveUI shines in and provide extra functionality
to make implementing an application on the basis of the MVVM
pattern easier.

My special thanks goes out to Lukas Rögner who wrote a lot of
the code and did a great deal of refactoring. Without him the
project would not have happened.
