![MVVM Framework Logo](https://github.com/lecode-official/mvvm-framework/blob/master/Documentation/Images/Logo1024x1024.png "MVVM Framework Logo")

This MVVM Framework was build on top of [ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI). It enhances ReactiveUI with a lot of utility functions such as
windowing and navigation services. This project aims at building on those features that [ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI) shines in and
provide extra functionality to make implementing an application on the basis of the MVVM pattern easier.

# First Steps
