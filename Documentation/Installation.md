The MVVM Framework was build on top of [ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI). It enhances [ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI)
with a lot of utility functions such as windowing and navigation services. This project aims at building on those features that
[ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI) shines at and provides extra functionality to make implementing an application on the basis of the MVVM
pattern easier.

# First Steps

If this is the first time that you are using the MVVM Framework you should head over to the
[quick start guide](https://github.com/lecode-official/mvvm-framework/blob/master/Documentation/QuickStart.md) to learn the basics. If you want to dig deeper,
please check out the [documentation](https://github.com/lecode-official/mvvm-framework/blob/master/Documentation/Documentation.md), which will provide you with a
lot of detail on each component of the framework.
