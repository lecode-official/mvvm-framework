The MVVM Framework is a compact and simple, yet powerful implementation of the MVVMV pattern. It provides a strong model for managing the application lifecycle
and the navigation. It was build on three important core priciples:

1. Decoupling operating system functionality from the application logic
2. Asynchronous from top to bottom using the task awaitable pattern
3. Playing nice with other frameworks

The MVVM framework decouples operation system functionality from the application logic by providing a powerful service system, which abstracts away any platform
specific code from the application logic. Everything in the framework was build with the task awaitable pattern in mind, from application lifecycle management to
navigation. The framework plays nice with all kinds of frameworks, for example the dependency injection mechanism build into the framework does not care what
kind of inversion of control container you are using.

# First Steps

If this is the first time that you are using the MVVM Framework you should head over to the
[quick start guide](https://github.com/lecode-official/mvvm-framework/blob/master/Documentation/QuickStart.md) to learn the basics. If you want to dig deeper,
please check out the [documentation](https://github.com/lecode-official/mvvm-framework/blob/master/Documentation/Documentation.md), which will provide you with a
lot of detail on each component of the framework.
