# Introduction

This MVVM Framework was build on top of [ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI). It enhances ReactiveUI with a lot of utility functions such as
windowing and navigation services. This project aims at building on those features that [ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI) shines in and
provide extra functionality to make implementing an application on the basis of the MVVM pattern easier.

As stated above, the MVVM Framework builds upon the work done by [ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI). It adds several utility functions, such
as application lifecycle management, navigation, and services most applications need. This makes it much easier to implement MVVM-based applications. Right now the
project only supports WPF projects, but this might change in the future and may libraries for mobile applications may be added.

Please note that this documentation is very much a work in progress. New chapters will be added in the future. Right now the focus lies on perfecting the quick
start, so that you are able to start using the project.

This documentation aims at giving you an overview of the means this framework provides to increase your productivity when implementing an MVVM-based application.
You start with the [Quick Start](https://github.com/lecode-official/mvvm-framework/blob/master/Documentation/QuickStart.md) and dive deeper into the other parts
of the documentation as you go.
