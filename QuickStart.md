# Introduction

The MVVM framework builds upon the work done by [ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI). It adds several utility functions, such
as application lifecycle management, navigation, and services most applications need. This makes it much easier to implement MVVM-based applications. Right now the
project only supports WPF projects, but this might change in the future and may libraries for mobile applications may be added.

# Using the MVVM framework

You can easily install the MVVM framework via NuGet:

```batch
PM> Install-Package System.Windows.Mvvm
```
